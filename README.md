# CI-CD-Docker:
    echo "# CI-CD-Docker" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/prakashpawar4u/CI-CD-Docker.git
    git push -u origin main


These test cases cover:

Infrastructure Tests: Helm chart integrity, Kubernetes resources, networking

Security Tests: RBAC, secrets management, security scanning

Performance Tests: Response times, throughput, scalability

Reliability Tests: Backup/recovery, disaster recovery, uptime

Compatibility Tests: Cross-browser, time synchronization

Documentation Tests: Availability of necessary docs

You can add these to your existing test file or create separate test files for better organization. The tests include both simulated checks (where you'd replace with actual implementation) and actual verification
